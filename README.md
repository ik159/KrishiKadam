# Purpose:
With agriculture being the primary source of income for India and such an important sector, it is important that our farmers are aware of their rights, needs and the various resources available for them, alongside with the knowledge of how they can implement these.

# Objective of the Project:
## We seek to provide three sections/kinds of information to our farmers in the form of an app+sensors to help them:
- Section 1: Awareness section: Aims to spread awareness, giving our farmers important information for their growth and development which will help them understand the advantages and opportunities available to them.
- Section 2: Current Crop/Soil Information: Gives our farmers alerts by using sensors that connect to the app and update the user of any important information such as humidity conditions, temperature, rain, soil moistness etc.
- Section 3: Predictive Analysis: Predicts and gives instructions to the farmers about what should be done for better quality and life of the crops, by using the information received by
the sensors alongside information of future weather forecasts and prior knowledge of crop
needs.
- Section 4: News Feed: Allows our users to come together and post updates on their requirements, needs and current happenings.
